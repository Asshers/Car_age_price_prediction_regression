# Car_age_price_prediction_regression

**Description:**

Welcome to the Car Age vs. Price dataset analysis repository! In this project, we explore the relationship between a car's age and its price. The dataset contains information about various cars, including their manufacturing year and corresponding prices.

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this analysis is to investigate whether a linear relationship exists between a car's age and its price. Additionally, we will compare the performance of two different regression models, Linear Regression and Lasso Regression, to find the best model for predicting car prices based on their age.

**Key Steps in this Repository:**

1. **Data Exploration:** We start by loading and exploring the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and gain insights into the distribution of the car ages and prices.

2. **Data Visualization:** Visualizations, such as scatter plots and regression lines, will be used to visualize the relationship between car age and price. This will help us gain an initial understanding of whether a linear relationship exists.

3. **Linear Regression:** We perform Linear Regression to fit a straight line that best represents the relationship between car age and price. The regression model will be evaluated based on various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

4. **Lasso Regression:** Lasso Regression, a regularized linear regression technique, will also be applied to the data. Lasso regression can help with feature selection and may provide a more robust model in the presence of multicollinearity.

5. **Model Comparison:** By comparing the performance metrics of both the Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models, we aim to determine which model is better suited for predicting car prices based on their age.

**Importance of the Analysis:**

Understanding the relationship between a car's age and its price is crucial for various stakeholders in the automotive industry. This analysis can provide valuable insights for car dealers, buyers, and manufacturers, helping them make informed decisions about pricing, depreciation rates, and overall market trends.

**Note:** The dataset used in this analysis is for educational and demonstrative purposes only. The actual car pricing and age data are fictional and not based on real-world values.
